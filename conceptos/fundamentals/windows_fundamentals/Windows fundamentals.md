##### Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP, port `3389`)
`Remote Desktop Connection` ([mstsc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc)).

As pentesters, we can benefit from looking for these saved Remote Desktop Files (`.rdp`) while on an engagement.

`lsass.exe` is the process that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on Windows systems.

The [SysInternals Tools suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals) is a set of portable Windows applications that can be used to administer Windows systems (for the most part without requiring installation).

```powershell
C:\htb> \\live.sysinternals.com\tools\procdump.exe -accepteula

ProcDump v9.0 - Sysinternals process dump utility
Copyright (C) 2009-2017 Mark Russinovich and Andrew Richards
Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com

Monitors a process and writes a dump file when the process exceeds the
specified criteria or has an exception.

Capture Usage:
   procdump.exe [-mm] [-ma] [-mp] [-mc Mask] [-md Callback_DLL] [-mk]
                [-n Count]
                [-s Seconds]
                [-c|-cl CPU_Usage [-u]]
powershell
<SNIP>
```

The suite includes tools such as `Process Explorer`, an enhanced version of `Task Manager`, and `Process Monitor`, which can be used to monitor file system, registry, and network activity related to any process running on the system. Some additional tools are TCPView, which is used to monitor internet activity, and PSExec, which can be used to manage/connect to systems via the SMB protocol remotely.

These tools can be useful for penetration testers to, for example, discover interesting processes and possible privilege escalation paths as well as for lateral movement.

## Service Permissions
- `services.msc`
Path to the executable is the full path to the program and command to execute when the service starts. If the NTFS permissions of the destination directory are configured with weak permissions, an attacker could replace the original executable with one created for malicious purposes.

The recovery tab allows steps to be configured should a service fail. Notice how this service can be set to run a program after the first failure. This is yet another vector that an attacker could use to run malicious programs by utilizing a legitimate service.

Notable built-in service accounts in Windows:
-   LocalService
-   NetworkService
-   LocalSystem

`Security Descriptor Definition Language` (`SDDL`).
Every named object in Windows is a [securable object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/securable-objects), and even some unnamed objects are securable. If it's securable in a Windows OS, it will have a [security descriptor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptors). Security descriptors identify the object’s owner and a primary group containing a `Discretionary Access Control List` (`DACL`) and a `System Access Control List` (`SACL`).

## Sessions
#### Interactive
An interactive, or local logon session, is initiated by a user authenticating to a local or domain system by entering their credentials.
`runas`

#### Non-interactive
used by the Windows operating system to automatically start services and applications without requiring user interaction.

| **Account** | **Description** |
| --------------|-------------------|
| Local System Account | Also known as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, this is the most powerful account in Windows systems. It is used for a variety of OS-related tasks, such as starting Windows services. This account is more powerful than accounts in the local administrators group. |
| Local Service Account | Known as the `NT AUTHORITY\LocalService` account, this is a less privileged version of the SYSTEM account and has similar privileges to a local user account. It is granted limited functionality and can start some services. |
| Network Service Account | This is known as the `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService` account and is similar to a standard domain user account. It has similar privileges to the Local Service Account on the local machine. It can establish authenticated sessions for certain network services. |

#### Interacting with the Operating System
- [RDP](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/186607/understanding-the-remote-desktop-protocol-rdp) port 3389 

[Windows Command Reference](https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/8/9/58911986-D4AD-4695-BF63-F734CD4DF8F2/ws-commands.pdf)

#### [cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-overview?view=powershell-7)

is a lightweight command that is used in the PowerShell environment.
Cmdlets are in the form of `Verb-Noun`. For example, the command `Get-ChildItem` can be used to list our current directory. Cmdlets also take arguments or flags. We can type `Get-ChildItem -` and hit the tab key to iterate through the arguments.

#### Aliases

Many cmdlets in PowerShell also have aliases. For example, the aliases for the cmdlet `Set-Location`, to change directories, is either `cd` or `sl`. Meanwhile, the aliases for `Get-ChildItem` are `ls` and `gci`. We can view all available aliases by typing `Get-Alias`.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> New-Alias -Name "Show-Files" Get-ChildItem
PS C:\> Get-Alias -Name "Show-Files"

CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           Show-Files
```

```powershell
PS C:\Users\htb-student> Get-Alias | findstr ipconfig
Alias           ifconfig -> ipconfig.exe
```


#### Execution Policy

| **Account** | **Description** |
| --------------|-------------------|
| `AllSigned` | All scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and configuration files. This includes both remote and local scripts. We receive a prompt before running scripts signed by publishers that we have not yet listed as either trusted or untrusted. |
| `Bypass` | No scripts or configuration files are blocked, and the user receives no warnings or prompts. |
| `Default` | This sets the default execution policy, `Restricted` for Windows desktop machines and `RemoteSigned` for Windows servers. |
| `RemoteSigned` | Scripts can run but requires a digital signature on scripts that are downloaded from the internet. Digital signatures are not required for scripts that are written locally. |
| `Restricted` | This allows individual commands but does not allow scripts to be run. All script file types, including configuration files (`.ps1xml`), module script files (`.psm1`), and PowerShell profiles (`.ps1`) are blocked. |
| `Undefined` | No execution policy is set for the current scope. If the execution policy for ALL scopes is set to undefined, then the default execution policy of `Restricted` will be used. |
| `Unrestricted` | This is the default execution policy for non-Windows computers, and it cannot be changed. This policy allows for unsigned scripts to be run but warns the user before running scripts that are not from the local intranet zone. |

A user can easily bypass the policy by either typing the script contents directly into the PowerShell window, downloading and invoking the script, or specifying the script as an encoded command. It can also be bypassed by adjusting the execution policy (if the user has the proper rights) or setting the execution policy for the current process scope

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y
